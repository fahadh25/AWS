# AWS
Through EC2 serial console, you have access to your Amazon EC2 instance's serial port, which you can use to troubleshoot boot, network configuration, and other issues. The serial console does not require your instance to have any networking capabilities. With the serial console, you can enter commands to an instance as if your keyboard and monitor are directly attached to the instance's serial port. The serial console session lasts during instance reboot and stop. During reboot, you can view all of the boot messages from the start.

Here is the process to configure EC2 Serial Console for AWS Windows instance.
